"""
scripts/move_arm.py  —  Phase 2 demo: smooth joint motion control.

Loads the pick-and-place scene (arm + table + 3 cubes + 3 targets), then
smoothly moves the arm through a few poses and opens/closes the gripper so
you can SEE controlled, non-jerky motion. No pick logic yet — that's Phase 3.

RUN WITH:   mjpython scripts/move_arm.py     (NOT python — macOS needs mjpython)
